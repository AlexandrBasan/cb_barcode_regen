<h3><center>CB Barcode ReGen</center></h3>
<p><b>CB Barcode ReGen</b> provides 2 functions, barcode generator and barcode reader. The generator module supports only QR code for now. The reader module supports UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, EAN-13, CODE-39, CODE-128, ITF and QR code.</p>
<p><b>Where the barcode is saved?</b><br />
All saved barcodes are saved in <code>/sdcard/data/com.cbsb.barcodegen</code> by the name in UUID style. This directory is created automatically on first use with ".nomedia" file to prevent <code>MediaScaner</code> to scan this directory. Since version 1.2, these barcodes are inserted to <code>MediaStorage</code> so you can access them through Gallery. The saved barcodes in this directory are necessary to prevent duplicate insertion in case you save or share the same barcode more than once.</p>
